ðŸ“„ Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Project Name: MBG Clinic Desktop App
Version: 1.0 (in development)
Date: April 13, 2025

1. ðŸ“˜ Overview
This application is a standalone desktop app for small clinics to manage patient records, visits, follow-up care, and simple reporting. It is built with Python (Tkinter UI) and SQLite to offer a lightweight, install-free experience on Windows PCs, replacing an Excel-based workflow.

The app ensures referential integrity, supports data backups and sharing, and will eventually be packaged into a single `.exe` file with the database stored as a separate file for flexibility.

2. ðŸŽ¯ Goals
- Replace Excel-based tracking with a structured database
- Allow non-technical users to view, enter, and edit data
- Ensure data integrity through relational design
- Keep `.db` file separate for backup, versioning, or multi-user handoff
- Package into a `.exe` for easy distribution
- Provide basic clinic reports and filtering tools

3. ðŸ–¥ Target Platform
- Windows 10/11 PCs
- No installation required (distributed as `.exe`)
- Python version for testing and dev

4. ðŸ§± Architecture
- Language: Python 3.11+
- UI Framework: Tkinter
- Database: SQLite 3 (`clinic_data.db`)
- Packaging: PyInstaller for `.exe` generation
